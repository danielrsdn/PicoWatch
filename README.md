# PicoWatch
PicoWatch is the ultimate smart home security solution that brings together cutting-edge technologies to keep you connected and informed about activity around your home. Using the Raspberry Pi Pico, an ultrasonic sensor, and an Arducam camera, PicoWatch detects movement and captures a flurry of photos that are processed and stored securely in the AWS cloud. With machine learning algorithms, PicoWatch analyzes the images to detect and identify faces, while providing physical and emotional state descriptions of the people in the images. The AWS SNS service sends real-time notifications to your smartphone or device, alerting you to any activity detected and keeping you in control. PicoWatch is not just a security solution, but a convenient and easy-to-use tool for parents, caregivers, and homeowners to check on their loved ones and property from anywhere. With its sleek design and powerful features, PicoWatch is the perfect choice for those who demand the best in smart home security.
